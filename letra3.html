                    All my friends are heathens, take it slow<br>
                    Wait for them to ask you who you know<br>
                    Please don't make any sudden moves<br>
                    You don't know the half of the abuse<br>

                    <br>
                    Welcome to the room of people<br>
                    Who have rooms of people that they loved one day<br>
                    Docked away<br>
                    Just because we check the guns at the door<br>
                    Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades<br>
                    <br>
                    You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you<br>
                    You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you<br>
                    You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"<br>
                    But after all I've said, please don't forget<br>

                    <br>
                    We don't deal with outsiders very well<br>
                    They say newcomers have a certain smell<br>
                    You have trust issues, not to mention<br>
                    They say they can smell your intentions<br>
                    <br>
                    You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you<br>
                    You'll have some weird people sitting next to you<br>
                    You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"<br>

                    Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed<br>
                    I tried to warn you just to stay away<br>
                    And now they're outside ready to bust<br>
                    It looks like you might be one of us<br>
