                    If you don't wanna see me<br>
                    <br>
                    Did a full one-eighty, crazy<br>
                    Thinking 'bout the way I was<br>
                    Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe<br>
                    But look at where I ended up<br>
                    I'm all good already<br>
                    So moved on, it's scary<br>
                    I'm not where you left me at all, so<br>
                    <br>
                    If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody<br>
                    If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br>
                    <br>
                    Don't show up, don't come out<br>
                    Don't start caring about me now<br>
                    Walk away, you know how<br>
                    Don't start caring about me now<br>
                    <br>
                    Aren't you the guy who tried to<br>
                    Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?<br>
                    Though it took some time to survive you<br>
                    I'm better on the other side<br>
                    I'm all good already<br>
                    So moved on, it's scary<br>
